## INTRODUCTION:
Hello, and welcome to my first PHP project for an e-commerce website. Feel free to use and moderate it, if not for commercial use, of course. This is free anyways. <br>
About the images, I will be ommiting them from this first few commits until I finish the code review. Amongst them are paid stock photos and licensed products and I do now have lawyer. <br>
But I assume the coding skill is more important, at least for a tech recruiter. <br>
Yes, I've noticed is kinda messy, but this was made a few years ago and I barely remember what I did in some components. And coding skills improve with time, I guess.
